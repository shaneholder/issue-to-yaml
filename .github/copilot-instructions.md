# Copilot Instructions for Cloud Environment Request Processing

When working in this repository, you have access to the `convert-issue-to-yaml` agent which can parse cloud environment request issues and convert them to structured YAML files.

## Usage

Use the agent when you need to:
- Convert a cloud environment request issue to a YAML configuration file
- Validate the extracted data against the schema
- Generate infrastructure-ready YAML from issue content
